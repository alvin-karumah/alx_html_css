        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p> Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology with significant implications across various   industries, including healthcare. This paper explores the impact of AI on healthcare and examines relevant information materials obtained from different types of sources, including print books, e-books, peer-reviewed journals, and reference books.</p>
        <h2>Print Books</h2>
        <p>One valuable print book on this topic is "Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: A Comprehensive Overview" by John Doe (2021). This book provides an in-depth analysis of AI applications in healthcare, ranging from diagnosis and treatment to patient monitoring and drug discovery. Doe's work synthesizes research findings and real-world case studies to illustrate the potential of AI in revolutionizing healthcare delivery. </p>
        <h3>E-books</h3>
        <p> An e-book titled "The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Precision Medicine" by Jane Smith (2022) further delves into the impact of AI on precision medicine. It explores how AI algorithms can analyze large datasets, such as genomics and medical imaging, to enable personalized treatment plans. Smith's e-book critically evaluates the challenges and ethical considerations associated with integrating AI into precision medicine</p>
        <p>The peer-reviewed journal article "Machine Learning Approaches for Early Detection of Cancer" by Williams et al. (2023) focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms in early cancer detection. This study highlights the potential of AI-driven techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer screening, thereby aiding in early intervention and better patient outcomes.</p>
